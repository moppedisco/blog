			<p>Communicating within an large organisation or between departments can sometimes be very tricky. Me and collegue found that just sending links of interesting articles often didn't get the attention we desired. That buzz in the cafeteria never really took off by doing that way.</p>
			<p>So we decided to create a beautiful designed newsletter that we'd send out in 2-3 week intervals with news and trends in UX, web design, technology, branding, marketing, to cover all aspects of the business we were in. Together with an few handpicked funny videos of cats and people falling the conversation in the end really took off.</p>
