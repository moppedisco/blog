Saying “no” is hard, even if it’s to a close friend.

###The Hard Way

The problem with saying “no” is that it often shuts down a conversation. This can leave a client or boss feeling defensive, that their ideas don’t matter, or, worse yet, that they’ve hired someone who can’t listen or be respectful. Nobody wants to lose a client or be fired, so we often won’t say “no” for this very reason.

Simply disagreeing or refusing also doesn't provide any extra value to the conversation. As a consultant or employee, it's often our job to provide solutions and offer an outside perspective; a flat “no” doesn’t give us an opportunity to do either.

Yet there are times when “no” really is the best answer. It can take some bravery to say, but it can also be an opportunity to build trust by offering up guidance, showing the other person that you genuinely understand a problem and its implications. These implications can be as straightforward as avoiding a costly design decision or something more nuanced like avoiding team burnout, or letting meaningful quality suffer.

Most of the time, however, we quickly consider all the things that could go wrong if we say “no” and end up just saying “yes” instead.

###The Easy Way

In a perfect world, we would be able to say “yes” to every single client demand, every project would complete under budget in half the time and we could all ride unicorns to work in the morning. But the world is far from perfect and blindly saying “yes” can land us in some serious trouble.

In The Clean Coder, Uncle Bob talks about how “yes” constitutes a significant commitment; that when you say it, you mean it. Time is limited and it's not always possible to fit everything in, but at the same time, over-promising and under-delivering is unprofessional. There really is nothing worse than taking on too much work only to deliver a low quality product.

We all have our reasons to say “yes.” The most obvious one is to avoid conflict, as most of us are conditioned to avoid it in the first place. But you may just be trying to prove your value or technical prowess. Or, perhaps, you just want to to be helpful. These are all poor reasons to just say “yes” and may just undermine your productivity and the overall health of the project.
