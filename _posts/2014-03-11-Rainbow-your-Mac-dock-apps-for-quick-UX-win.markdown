Setting up a new computer is great fun. There is a certain satisfaction in starting fresh and getting everything just "right". I especially enjoy installing all my must have apps and try optimizing them in terms of: 

"Does it open faster than before?" <br>
"What apps do I really need" etc. 

Another "game" I've recently pickup in this subject is to organize my Mac dock in the most effecient way.
