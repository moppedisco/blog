description: 	Travelling and learning can be a great way to get out and see the world. Sometimes you just need some inspiration to get out there.

<p>Travel and learning are the two corner stones of this campaign. By providing the user with a range of future scenarios and emotions within travel and learning we'd help the user to visualize it by creating a uniq video based on his/her selections. </p>	
<p>My role in this project involved translating the business needs to a working user flow and website and also to do technical evaluation of what is possible in terms of technology since one of the business needs was allowing the user to create their own video in a seamless manner on all platforms.</p>
