			<p>Travel and learning were premises for this campaign. By providing the user with a range of scenarios and emotions within travel and learning we'd help the user to visualize it by creating a uniq video based on his/her selections. </p>
			<p>My role in this project started with me helping the art director realize his vision by creating and modifing initial prototypes and at the same time explore possible technical solution that we could continue develop. Later once the prototype was "ready" my role development more towards a scrum master role overseeing and supporting developers on the continues build.</p>
