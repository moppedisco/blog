description: 	A previous satisfied client recommended me for this project which required building a saucy one pager for a hot healthy startup in the restaurant scene.

<p>Gärtnerei are pretty new on the Zurich restaurant scene with healthy and fresh food. They needed some help with a brand new responsive website that they after the build could manage and further develope themself. This was the single most important thing I focused on building the website even tho the client didn't ask for it. Call it backend UX if you want but I've found that this is how clients to some extent judge your work, if they can't do simple changes on their site or not. So far they've been very pleased with the result.</p>
