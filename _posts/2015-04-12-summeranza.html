<p>Summeranza is an annual music festival held for 10,000 EF students in London, England. In 2015 together two collegues we completely rebranded the festival with a new logo, color scheme, website, signage, tickets, merchandise, wrist bands, animal masks... the works. </p>

<p>But wow. This was not easy journey. The initiative came from our selfs that wanted to do something radical and cool, relatively speaking, compared to the regular branding exercise we always did. The task landed on our table like it always did with this project. "Redesign the website but keep it in line with the brand". <b>From that moment we just did the opposite.</b> Looking at the previous years versions we knew we couldn't continue on like we always did. We had to gamble a bit. The talent was there in the team but we just had to feed it properly to prosper. </p>

<p>In the end the festival site was named HMTL Awards Site of the Day and picked up a Site of the Day Honorable Mention from the good folks at Awwwards.</p>
