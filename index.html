		<p>Hi there, I'm <span class="capit">Yacine</span> —<br>A digital hipster based in <span class="capit">Zürich</span> <br> with expertise in <span class="typer" data-typer-targets="frontend development,interaction design,wireframing,coming late to work,not getting stressed">frontend development</span></p>
