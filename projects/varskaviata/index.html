	<h1>A Stockholm restaurant guide</h1>
	<p>If you don't bring food from home or you're a genius working for a hot startup that provides free meals then <b>what</b> and <b>where</b> to eat is two questions you get confronted with on a regular basis around noon. </p>

	<p>Using services like google or yelp can help but are most likely not very accurate when it comes to showing that fast food hotdog joint around the corner that you know exist but doesn’t show up in your searches. There is always your country specific yellow pages like sites but they aren't really famous for UX and up to date data. </p>

	<p><b>So in the end we’re stuck with incomplete data and bad UX.</b>
	<br>Its on those premise i decided that surely something better can be done.  </p>
	<h2>Search bar</h2>
	<p>The search bar is pretty straight forward. Enter address and hit search.  </p>

	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>This is where the magic happens. Getting a clear overview of what a pin on a map represents say on google or yelp isn't always straight forward. Yes the pins shows the location but why not sure more information relative to the search, and in this case showing the cuising can easily be done. </p>
