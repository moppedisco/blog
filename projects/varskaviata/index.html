		<p>If you don't bring food from home or you're a one of those guys working for a hot startup that provides free meals then <b>what</b> and <b>where</b> to <b>eat</b> is two questions you get confronted with on a regular basis around noon. </p>

		<p>Using services like Google or Yelp are very useful but are most likely not very accurate when it comes to showing that fast food hotdog joint around the corner that you know exist but doesnâ€™t show up in your searches.</p>
		<p><b>You see the problem now? </b><br>What else do these services not show when you search?</p>
		
		<h2>Objectives</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>More relevent results than equivelent Google search</li>
			<li>Easier search result overview than Google</li>
			<li>Create a buzz around the product</li>
		</ol>

				<b>Categorization</b>
				<p><small>An important feature was to categorize all restaurants by the cuisine they provided. <br>I chose to highlight that attribute on the map by showing the representive country flag of that cuisine instead of doing like other services do, by the restaurant name, result number or by an icon. <br> I found information of that type irrelant when trying to answers the questions <b>where</b> and <b>what</b> to eat. </small></p>
