		<p><b>Lesson learned: </b> <i>Tools are great but curated or user generated content rules no matter how cool your tool is.</i></p>
		<p>If you don't bring food from home or you're one of those guys working for a hot startup that provides free meals then <b>what</b> and <b>where</b> to eat is two questions you get confronted with on a regular basis around noon. </p>

		<p>Using services like Google or Yelp can be useful but are not very accurate when it comes to showing that fast food hotdog joint around the corner that you know exist but doesnâ€™t show up in your searches.</p>
		<p>The main problem is that these services aren't local enough and using a local yellow pages site will most likely just be an index of restaurant companies, catering etc and not actual restaurants.</p>

				<b style="color:green;">Results</b>
				<ul class="ul-inline">
					<li>The site launched 1st of December 2009</li>
					<li>Reached <b>4850 unique visits</b> during a 3 day period.</li>
					<li>Got referred on twitter by popular internet columnist <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/nanok/status/6265178319">@nanok</a> <i>- Surely not much but a first public appreciation for something I built and designed. </i></li>

		<h2>1. Simple search</h2>
		<p>An important feature was to categorize all restaurants by the cuisine they provided. I chose to highlight that attribute on the map by showing the representive country flag of that cuisine instead of doing like many other sites do, by the restaurant name, result number or by an icon. </p>
		<div class="fullWidth">
			<div class="fullWidth__outside">
				<h3>search result</h3>
				<p>By visualiziation the restaurants by country flag helped me answering my two core questions,<br> <b>where</b> and <b>what</b> to eat. </p>

		<h2>2. Navigating results</h2>
		<p>Navigating the results and getting detailed information about a restaurant was a feature that needed to be fast and seamless. By showing restaurants names on mouseover it was an easy and unintrusive way of "filtering" results that the user might already have come across. <p>Clicking the restaurants would open an expanded box with detailed information about the restaurant. This meant that detailed information about a restaurant would always be only <b>1 click</b> away.</p>
