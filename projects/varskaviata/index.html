	<h1>A Stockholm restaurant guide</h1>
	<p>Not being one of the lucky ones working at a cool company that offers free meals, eating at a restaurant for lunch once or twice a week is pretty standard issue. The next step in the process usually evolves around the questions where and what to eat.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately most <i>"restaurant guide sites"</i> dont focus on small neighborhood restaurants, fast food joints or cafe that serve food so your search will most likely be an incomplete one.</p>
	<p><b>On those premises i decided to try building my own restaurant guide.</b></p>
