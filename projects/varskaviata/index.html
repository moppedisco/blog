	<h1>A Stockholm restaurant guide</h1>
	<p><a href="http://varskaviata.nu" target="_blank">www.varskaviata.nu</a></p>
	<p>If you don't bring food from home or you're a genius working for a hot startup that provides free meals then <b>what</b> and <b>where</b> to <b>eat</b> is two questions you get confronted with on a regular basis around noon. </p>

	<p>Using services like Google or Yelp are very useful but are most likely not very accurate when it comes to showing that fast food hotdog joint around the corner that you know exist but doesnâ€™t show up in your searches.</p>
	<p><b>With that in mind, what else do these services not show when you search?</b><br> Surely something better can be built.</p>
	
	<h2>The goal</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>More relevent results than equivelent Google search</li>
		<li>Easier search result overview than Google</li>
		<li>Create a buzz around the product</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>The result</h2>
