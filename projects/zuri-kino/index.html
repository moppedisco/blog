		<h1>Better cinema sites</h1>

		<p>Navigating websites in a foreign language obviously has its difficulties. With me currently living in Switzerland this has become present in my daily online life when checking restaurant opening hours, buying movie tickets etc.</p>
		<p>The latter one, finding what movies run at the cinemas, if found especially annoying. The crook here was <a href="http://cineman.ch" target="_blank">cineman.ch</a>, Switzerlands biggest movie site. Tons of ads and poor information structure I found myself opening new tabs for each movie to compare movie data and simultaneously googling their IMDB rating. Web 2014 can surely be done better.</p>
		<h2>Objectives</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Show IMDB data.</li>
			<li>Showcase movies in a sexier way.</li>
			<li>Be able to compare movies in the same view.</li>
		</ul>
